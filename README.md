# gomoku

The goal of this project is to implement a Gomoku Narabe game bot (also called Wuzi Qi, Slope, Darpion or Five in a Row), focusing on the performance of its artificial intelligence.

Your bot must be compliant with the communication protocol, but only the mandatory part.

Feel free to implement an algorithm of your choice for your bot (Min-max, Monte-Carlo, Machine Learning or other). You will be evaluated on the efficiency of your bot, and on this criterion alone.

See the subject for further details !
